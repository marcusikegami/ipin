                    <p className="">
                        Rick Ikegami received his Bachelor’s in Science from the University of Utah and continued on to
                        obtain his MBA from Westminster College with a focus on Health Care Marketing. Serving as an
                        expert in business development with a keen understanding of the health care market here in
                        Utah, Rick has spent the last 32 years of his career helping health care professionals grow their
                        business, with the last 15 years being dedicated primarily to personal injury. Rick understands
                        the nuances of personal injury and has made it a personal goal to improve the experiences of
                        both patient and provider. Rick started IPIN with the understanding that there was a need for
                        under-privileged patients, involved in personal injury cases, to receive the treatment that they
                        otherwise would not be able to afford.
                        Rick loves to spend time with his four children, Ashley, Kobe, Marcus, and Maya. As a family
                        they love the outdoors, Utah Utes football, the Utah Jazz, golfing, and bowling. Rick also has a
                        taste for art and watches and likes to look for new additions to his collections.
